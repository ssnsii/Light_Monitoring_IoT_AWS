# Light Monitoring IoT System
## Project Overview

### End-to-end Real-Time IoT Light Monitoring System

This project demonstrates a complete IoT pipeline for monitoring light exposure. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller with an LM393 light sensor to collect real-time light data, publishes it to AWS IoT Core via MQTT, stores it in MongoDB Atlas, and uses Python and Dash for aggregation, analysis, and interactive visualization.

### Key Highlights:
Real-time light monitoring with automated data collection.
Cloud integration using AWS IoT Core.
Efficient storage and query with MongoDB Atlas.
Interactive visualization and analysis using Python and Dash.
